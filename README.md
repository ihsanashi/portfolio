# Introduction

This is a repo for my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. Currently I'm making major changes to my online presence, and hence this repo will go through a few iterations before it's ready for a relaunch. Due to that, this readme file will also need to be revamped once I've finalized the structure and content.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result.
